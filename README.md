As of right now, this project is really just an exploration of what I can put together, given my limited knowledge. 
As such it will be loosely structured, and focused around rapid iteration, rather than actually producing a product.

If the project ever reaches a point where I'm confident it can be made into a full fledged app, I'll restructure this
repository to facilitate that focus.

Until then, I'm gonna be learning a lot about Github and Netcode. (If Github is anything like Perforce, I may be ok.)
